# BioData Manager

> A simple blockchain-powered web app to add & view personal biodata, built for beginners exploring Web3.

## 🔍 Project Description  
BioData Manager is a decentralized application (DApp) that lets users securely store and retrieve biodata entries via a smart contract. The frontend is deployed and interacts with the contract through a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask). This makes it a great learning project for understanding how web apps and smart contracts can work together.

## 🎯 What It Does  
- Lets a user **enter biodata** (for example: name, age, gender, etc.) through a friendly UI.  
- Sends that data to a deployed smart contract and stores it on-chain.  
- Fetches and displays a list of all stored biodata entries.  
- Runs entirely in the browser (with a Web3 wallet) and is deployed live so you can try it instantly.

## ✨ Features  
- **Blockchain-backed data storage**: All entries go through a smart contract for transparency and immutability.  
- **Clean web interface**: Simple and beginner-friendly UI so you don’t have to struggle with complexity.  
- **Live deployment**: No need to spin up your own server just to try it — it’s already online.  
- **Easy to extend**: Code structure makes it straightforward to add more fields, more CRUD operations, or different data types.
